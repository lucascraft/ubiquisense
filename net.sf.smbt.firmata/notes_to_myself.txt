Notes to myself

in the context of Firmata protocol :

- see if exists a way to properly address * devices w/ funnelIO
- Session+funnel ID ?
- XBee special configuration for multipoint ?


The idea would be to be able to create an install where all the hardware is blended and host emulated for various IOs (in a Funnel way I guess)

Advantages : 
  - 1 XBee topology configuration : All work done in the host side thanks to 1 device - 1 Arduino abstraction blender
  - Piloting/monitoring made easier w/ Metamodel based capabilities
  - Is device auto discovery (w/ XBee config) a Firmata possibility (to eplore ???)
  - Think to a dedicated UI for Arduino blended layer (inspire ourselve from Some existing stuff ? Could be rapidly done in JFace (sliders + combos ... more ?)
