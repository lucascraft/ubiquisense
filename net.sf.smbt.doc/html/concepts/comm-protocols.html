<h1>Communication Protocols</h1>
<p>
Ubiquisense proposes an abstract communication model decoupling transport from protocol, relying on full-duplex queuing infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
By selecting a communication protocol, you choose to only accept this particular protocol framing into a communication channel. 
</p>
<p>
The communication channel will then be the tube transporting corresponding frames.  
</p>
<p>
This model proposes several main communication protocols : 
<ul>
<li>OSC</li>
<li>Firmata</li>
<li>DMX</li>
<li>Midi</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>OSC : Open Sound Control</h2>
<p>
This protocol is known as a Midi replacement. It is the Ubiquisense pivotal protocol. All information is expressed as '/' separated message with associated arguments.
</p>
 
<h2>DMX</h2>
<p>
Lighting protocol massively distributed worlwide. Ubiquisense mainly rely on OpenDMX APIs which are associated to the ENTTEC PRO USB devices.
</p>

<h2>Midi</h2>
<p>
This protocol is the worldwide standard for digital musical devices controllers. Ubiquisense offers a native routing for it.
