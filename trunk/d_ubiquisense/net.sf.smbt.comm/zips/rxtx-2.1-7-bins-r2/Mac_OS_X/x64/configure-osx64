A. Make /var/spool/uucp and /var/lock if there arenÕt these.

sudo mkdir /var/spool/uucp
sudo mkdir /var/lock

B. Change the permission and group of made directories.

sudo chmod 775 /var/spool/uucp
sudo chmod 775 /var/lock
sudo chgrp uucp /var/spool/uucp
sudo chgrp uucp /var/lock

C. Confirm the permission and group of made directories.

The output is shown as follows if your operation is correct.
ls -l /var/spool/ | grep uucp
> drwxrwxr-x 2 _uucp _uucp 68 5 19 03:15 uucp

ls -l /var/ | grep lock
> drwxrwxr-x 20 root _uucp 680 10 7 14:26 lock
