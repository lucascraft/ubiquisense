<p>
Electronic devices connect to one another in a variety of ways:
A cable connects a computer's processing unit to a display, a data
cable and a docking cradle connect a personal digital assistant (PDA)
or a cellular phone to a computer, radio waves connect a cordless phone
to its base unit, an infrared beam connects a remote control to a
television. The elaborate array of connectors among electronic devices
cries out for a better solution. That's where Bluetooth comes in.
</p>
<p>
Bluetooth is a completely different way to form
connections between electronic devices in close proximity. You can
think of it as <i>a cable-replacement technology</i>,
but its applications are limited only by our imaginations. Bluetooth
does more than just replace cables. It is a radio-frequency technology
that uses the 2.4 GHz Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) band. If you
have a baby monitor or a garage-door opener you're already using the
ISM band.
</p>
<p>
This two-part series of articles will show you how to use J2ME and 
Bluetooth to
develop next-generation wireless applications for tomorrow's market.
This first article covers the basics of Bluetooth; the next one will
concentrate on using the Java APIs for Bluetooth Wireless Technology 
(JSR 82)
to develop Java technology-enabled applications for Bluetooth-enabled 
devices. This article
starts by presenting a brief overview of the technology, then explains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The differences between Bluetooth and two similar technologies, 
infrared and 802.11b</li><li>Features and future applications</li>
<li>The architecture of Bluetooth and its protocol stack</li>
<li>Network topologies</li>
<li>Procedures for establishing connections</li>
<li>The role of profiles</li>
<li>Security considerations</li>
<li>Products now on the market</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overview of Bluetooth</h3>
<p>
The Bluetooth wireless connectivity technology was originally
envisioned in 1994 by the Swedish phone equipment maker Ericsson as a
way for mobile devices to communicate with each other at short ranges --
up to 30 feet, or 10 meters. In 1998, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia, and
Toshiba formed the Bluetooth Special Interest Group consortium to
develop a royalty-free, open specification for short-range wireless
connectivity. Since then, more than 2000 companies have joined the
Bluetooth SIG, including virtually all manufacturers of phone,
computer, and PDA equipment.
</p>
<p>
While Bluetooth is positioned as a replacement for cable, infrared, and 
other connection media,
it offers a variety of other services, and creates opportunities for
new usage models. For instance, it's also a good technology for
synchronizing devices. It works quietly, unconsciously, and
automatically in the background.</p>
<p>
"Bluetooth" was the nickname of Harald
Blåtland II, king of Denmark from 940 to 981, who united all of
Denmark and part of Norway under his rule. A runic stone has been
erected in his capital city, Jelling. The runes say:
</p>
<p>
</p><pre>Harald Christianized the Danes
Harald controlled Denmark and Norway
Harald thinks notebooks and cellular phones should communicate seamlessly
</pre>

<h4>Bluetooth vs. Infrared</h4>
<p>
Home electronics devices like TVs and VCRs communicate using
beams of light in the infrared spectrum. Infrared is fairly reliable
and doesn't cost much to build into devices. It does have drawbacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It's line-of-sight, so a sender must align with its receiver.</li>
<li>It's one-to-one, so a device can't send to multiple receivers at the
 same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Infrared's advantages are consequences of its disadvantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it's line-of-sight, interference is uncommon.</li>
<li>Because
it's one-to-one, message delivery is reliable: each message sent goes
to the intended recipient no matter how many infrared receivers are in
the room.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bluetooth vs. 802.11b</h4>
<p>
While both Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11b are wireless
communication protocols and both operate in the 2.4GHz band, it is
important not to visualize Bluetooth as a replacement for 802.11
wireless LAN technology. They're designed to accomplish different
goals.
</p>
<p>
The 802.11b protocol is designed to connect relatively large devices
with lots of power and speed, such as desktops and laptops. Devices
communicate at up to 11 Mbit/sec, at greater distances (up to 300 feet,
or 100 meters). By contrast, Bluetooth is designed to connect small
devices like PDAs, mobile phones, and peripherals at slower speeds (1
Mbit/sec), within a shorter range (30 feet, or 10 meters), which
reduces power requirements.

Another major difference is that 802.11b wasn't designed for
voice communications, while any Bluetooth connection can support both
data and voice communications.

automatic. You don't have to keep track of cables, connectors, and
connections, and you don't need to do anything special to initiate
communications. Devices find each other automatically and start
conversing without user input, expect where authentication is required;
for example, users must log in to use their email accounts.</li>
<li>Bluetooth is inexpensive. Market analysts peg the cost to 
incorporate Bluetooth
technology into a PDA, cell phone, or other product at around $20 now,
and say that it could fall to as little as $5 per unit.</li>
<li>The ISM band that Bluetooth uses is regulated,
but unlicensed. Governments have converged on a single standard, so
it's possible to use the same devices virtually wherever you travel, and
 you don't need to obtain legal permission in
advance to begin using the technology.</li>
<li>Bluetooth handles both data and voice. Its
ability to handle both kinds of transmissions simultaneously makes
possible such innovations as a mobile hands-free headset for voice with
applications that print to fax, and that synchronize the address books
on your PDA, your laptop, and your cell phone.</li>
<li>Signals are omni-directional and
can pass through walls and briefcases. &nbsp;Communicating devices don't
need to be aligned and don't need an unobstructed line of sight.</li>
<li>Bluetooth uses <span style="font-style: italic;">frequency hopping</span>.
 Its <span style="font-style: italic;">spread spectrum</span> approach 
greatly reduces the risk that communications will be intercepted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bluetooth Applications</h4>
<p>
Bluetooth wireless technology can be used for these applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>File transfer.</li>
<li>Ad-hoc networking: Communicating devices can spontaneously form a 
community of
networks that persists only as long as it's needed</li>
<li>Device synchronization: Seamless connectivity
among PDAs, computers, and mobile phones allows applications to update
information on multiple devices automatically when data on any one 
device changes.</li>
<li>Peripheral connectivity.</li>
<li>Car kits:Hands-free packages enable users to access phones and other
 devices without taking their hands off the steering wheel</li>
<li>Mobile
payments: Your Bluetooth-enabled phone can communicate with a
Bluetooth-enabled vending machine to buy a can of Diet Pepsi, and put
the charge on your phone bill.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Bluetooth Network Topology</b>
</p>
<p>
Bluetooth-enabled devices are organized in groups called <span 
style="font-style: italic;">piconets</span>.
A piconet consists of a master and up to seven active slaves. A master
and a single slave use point-to-point communication; if there are
multiple slaves, point-to-multipoint communication is used. A master
unit is the device that initiates the communication. A device in one
piconet can communicate to another device in another piconet, forming a <i>scatternet</i>,
 as depicted in Figure 1. Notice that a master in one  piconet may be a 
slave in another piconet:
</p>

width="350">
<br>
<span class="rtbtitle">Figure 1: Scatternet Comprising Three Piconets</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
The normal duration of transmission is one slot, and a packet
can last up to five time slots in length. In order to support
full-duplex communications, Bluetooth uses a time-division multiplexing
(TDM) scheme, in which a master device always uses an even-numbered slot
when it transmits, and a slave uses an odd-numbered slot.
</p>
<h4>Low-Power Operating Modes</h4>
<p>
Bluetooth defines provisions for three low-power operating modes in 
order to conserve battery life:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In <i>sniff</i> mode, a slave listens at a reduced level and doesn't
 take an active role in the piconet.</li>
<li>A device in <i>hold</i>
mode transmits no data, but its clock continues to operate, and a slave
remains in synchronization with the master. &nbsp;The device is not an
active member of the piconet, but it retains its active member address.
Power requirements decrease as a device goes from sniff to hold.</li>
<li><i>Park</i><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> mode is like 
hold mode
in that the slave is synchronized to the master but is not part of the
traffic. In this mode, however, the slave doesn't retain its active
member address. Power requirements decrease still further as a device
goes from hold to park.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Bluetooth Protocol Stack</h4>
<p>
The Bluetooth specification is over 1500 pages long and
contains the information necessary to ensure that diverse devices
supporting this technology can communicate with each other worldwide.
The specification is divided into two sections: <a 
href="https://www.bluetooth.org/spec/" target="_blank">Core 
Specification (Volume I)</a> and Profile Definitions (Volume 2).
</p>
<p>
Here's a high-level view of the architecture of the Bluetooth protocol 
stack:
</p>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" 
width="400">
<tbody><tr>
<td align="center">
<img 
src="Wireless%20Application%20Programming%20with%20J2ME%20and%20Bluetooth_fichiers/fig2.gif"
 alt="Bluetooth Protocol Stack" border="0" height="382" width="383">
<br>
<span class="rtbtitle">Figure 2: Bluetooth Protocol Stack</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
The responsibilities of the layers in this stack are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>The radio layer</i> is the physical wireless connection. To avoid 
interference with other devices that communicate in the ISM band,
the modulation is based on fast frequency hopping. Bluetooth divides
the 2.4 GHz frequency band into 79 channels 1 MHz apart (from 2.402 to
2.480 GHz), and uses this spread spectrum to hop from one channel to
another, up to 1600 times a second. The standard wavelength range is 10
cm to 10 m, and can be extended to 100 m by increasing transmission
power.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>The baseband layer</i> is responsible for
controlling and sending data packets over the radio link. It provides
transmission channels for both data and voice. The baseband layer
maintains Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) links for voice and
Asynchronous Connectionless (ACL) links for data. SCO packets are never
retransmitted but ACL packets are, to ensure data integrity.
</p>
<p>
SCO links are point-to-point
symmetric connections, where time slots are reserved to guarantee
timely transmission. A slave device is allowed to respond during the
time slot immediately following an SCO transmission from the master. A
master can support up to three SCO links to a single slave or to
multiple slaves, and a single slave can support up to two SCO links to
different slaves.
</p>
<p>
Data transmissions on ACL links, on the other hand, are established on a
per-slot basis (using slots not reserved for SCO links). ACL links
support point-to-multipoint transmissions. After an ACL transmission
from the master, only a slave addressed specifically may respond during
the next time slot; if no device is addressed, the message is treated
as a broadcast.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>The Link Manager Protocol (LMP)</i>
uses the links set up by the baseband to establish connections and
manage piconets. Responsibilities of the LMP also include
authentication and security services, and monitoring of service quality.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>The Host Controller Interface (HCI)</i> is
the dividing line between software and hardware. The L2CAP and layers
above it are currently implemented in software, and the LMP and lower
layers are in hardware. The HCI is the driver interface for the
physical bus that connects these two components. The HCI may not be
required. The L2CAP may be accessed directly by the application, or
through certain support protocols provided to ease the burden on
application programmers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<i>The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)</i>
receives application data and adapts it to the Bluetooth format. Quality
of Service (QoS) parameters are exchanged at this layer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Establishing a Network Connection</h4>
<p>
When a device is not connected to a piconet, it is in a standby
mode. In this mode, the device listens for messages every 1.28 seconds
over 32 hop frequencies. When one device wishes to establish a
connection with another, it sends out 16 identical <span 
style="font-style: italic;">page</span>
messages on 16 hop frequencies. If the slave doesn't respond, the master
retransmits the page message on the other 16 hop frequencies. If the
master doesn't know the slave's address it must precede the page
message with an <i>inquiry</i> message, which requires
an extra response from the slave unit. When the slave responds to the
page message, the master can begin transmitting voice or data.
</p>
<p>
To understand how Bluetooth-enabled devices establish
network connections, let's assume that Sally wishes to access her
e-mail messages from her Bluetooth-enabled device as she enters a hotel
or a mall. Once Sally taps the email application icon, the following
procedures are carried out automatically:
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Inquire</i>: In a new
environment, the device automatically initiates an inquiry to find an
access point. All nearby access points respond with their addresses,
and the device picks one.</li>
<li><i>Page</i>: The paging procedure synchronizes the device with the 
access point.</li>
<li><i>Establish a link</i>: The Link Manager Protocol establishes a 
link with the access point.</li>
<li><i>Discover services</i>:
The LMP uses the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) to find out what
services are available from the access point. Here we assume that the
email service is available.</li>
<li><i>Create an L2CAP Channel</i>:
The LMP uses information obtained from the Service Discovery Protocol
(SDP) to create an L2CAP channel to the access point. The application
may use this channel directly or use a protocol like RFCOMM (Radio
Frequency Communications Protocol) that might be running over L2CAP.
RFCOMM emulates a serial line.</li>
<li><i>Create an RFCOMM channel</i>:
Depending on the needs of the application, an RFCOMM channel (or
another channel) is created over the L2CAP channel. Creating an RFCOMM
channel allows an existing application that works with serial ports to
work with Bluetooth as well, without any modifications.</li>
<li><i>Authenticate</i>:
This is the only step that requires input from the user. If the access
point requires authentication, it will send an authentication request,
and the user will be prompted to enter a PIN to access the service. For
security reasons, the PIN code itself is not sent over the wireless
link, but rather a key generated from it.</li>
<li><i>Log in</i>: If the devices use the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) 
over RFCOMM, a serial port is emulated,
and Sally can log in to her email account.</li>
<li><i>Send and receive data</i>: The email client and the access point 
now use standard network protocols like TCP/IP to send and receive data.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bluetooth Profiles</h3>
<p>
Bluetooth profiles are intended to ensure interoperability
among Bluetooth-enabled devices and applications from different
manufacturers and vendors. A profile defines the roles and capabilities
for specific types of applications. Note well that Bluetooth devices 
cannot interact unless they conform to a
particular profile -- having the bare minimum Bluetooth stack isn't
enough.</p>
<p>
All of the Bluetooth profiles are defined in <a 
href="https://www.bluetooth.org/spec/" target="_blank">Volume II</a> of 
the Bluetooth specification. Here are some of them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Generic Access Profile</i>
defines connection procedures, device discovery, and link management. It
also defines procedures related to use of different security models and
common format requirements for parameters accessible on the user
interface level. At a minimum all Bluetooth devices must support this 
profile.</li>
<li>The <i>Service Discovery Application and Profile</i>
defines the features and procedures for an application in a Bluetooth
device to discover services registered in other Bluetooth devices, and
retrieves information related to the services.</li>
<li>The <i>Serial Port Profile</i> defines the
requirements for Bluetooth devices that need to set up connections that
emulate serial cables and use the RFCOMM protocol.</li>
<li>The <i>LAN Access Profile</i>
defines how Bluetooth devices can access the services of a LAN using
PPP, and shows how PPP mechanisms can be used to form a network
consisting of Bluetooth devices.</li>
<li>The <i>Synchronization Profile</i> defines the application 
requirements for Bluetooth devices that need to synchronize data on two 
or more devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bluetooth Security</h3>
<p>
Security is provided in three ways: pseudo-random frequency
hopping, authentication, and encryption. Frequency hops make it
difficult for anyone to eavesdrop. Authentication allows a user to
limit connectivity to specified devices. &nbsp;Encryption uses secret
keys to make data intelligible only to authorized parties.
</p>
<p>
All Bluetooth-enabled devices must
implement the Generic Access Profile, which contains all the Bluetooth
protocols and possible devices. This profile defines a security model
that includes three security modes:
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Mode 1</i> is an insecure mode of operation. No security 
procedures are initiated.</li>
<li><i>Mode 2</i> is known as <i>service-level enforced security</i>.
When devices operate in this mode, no security procedures are initiated
before the channel is established. This mode enables applications to
have different access policies and run them in parallel.</li>
<li><i>Mode 3</i> is known as <i>link-level enforced security</i>. In 
this mode, security procedures are initiated before link setup is 
complete.</li>
</ol>

<b>Bluetooth Products on the Market</b>
</p>
<p>
Since the inception of Bluetooth technology,
companies that have adopted it have been developing products for it.
Bluetooth products on the market today range from PC cards available
from IBM and Toshiba to a hands-free car kit. Like 802.11b wireless LAN
cards, the PC cards slide into a PCMCIA slot on a laptop but, while
802.11b wireless cards connect a computer wirelessly to a LAN,
Bluetooth cards connect a device to other Bluetooth-enabled devices.
More than 800 <a
