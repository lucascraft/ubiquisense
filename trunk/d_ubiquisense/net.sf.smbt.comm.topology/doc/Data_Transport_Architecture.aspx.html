<p>The <em>Bluetooth</em> data transport system follows a layered 
architecture. This description of the <em>Bluetooth</em> system 
describes the <em>Bluetooth</em> core transport layers up to and 
including L2CAP channels. All <em>Bluetooth</em> operational modes 
follow the same generic transport architecture.</p>
<p>For efficiency and legacy reasons, the <em>Bluetooth</em> transport 
architecture includes a sub-division of the logical layer, 
distinguishing between logical links and logical transports. This 
sub-division provides a general and commonly understood concept of a 
logical link that provides an independent transport between two or more 
devices. The logical transport sub-layer is required to describe the 
inter-dependence between some of the logical link types, mainly for 
reasons of legacy behavior.</p>
<p>The <em>Bluetooth</em> 1.1 specification described the ACL and SCO 
links as physical links. With the addition of extended SCO (eSCO) and 
for future expansion it is better to consider these as logical transport
 types, which more accurately encapsulates their purpose. However, they 
are not as independent as might be desired, due to their shared use of 
resources such as the LT_ADDR and acknowledgement/repeat request (ARQ) 
scheme. Hence the architecture is incapable of representing these 
logical transports with a single transport layer. The additional logical
 transport layer goes some way towards describing this behavior.</p><a 
name="1"></a>
<p></p>
<h2>Core Traffic Bearers</h2>The <em>Bluetooth</em> core system provides
 a number of standard traffic bearers for the transport of service 
protocol and application data. 
<p></p>
<p>The logical links are named using the names of the associated logical
 transport and a suffix that indicates the type of data that is 
transported: C for control links carrying LMP messages, U for L2CAP 
links carrying user data (L2CAP PDUs) and S for stream links carrying 
unformatted synchronous or isochronous data. It is common for the suffix
 to be removed from the logical link without introducing ambiguity, thus
 a reference to the default ACL logical transport can be resolved to 
mean the ACL-C logical link in cases where the LMP protocol is being 
discussed, or the ACL-U logical link when the L2CAP layer is being 
discussed.</p>
<p>The mapping of application traffic types to <em>Bluetooth</em> core 
traffic bearers is based on matching the traffic characteristics with 
the bearer characteristics. It is recommended to use these mappings as 
they provide the most natural and efficient method of transporting the 
data with its given characteristics.</p>
<p>An application, or an implementation of the <em>Bluetooth</em> core 
system, may choose to use a different traffic bearer or a different 
mapping to achieve a similar result. For example, in a piconet with only
 one slave, the master may choose to transport L2CAP broadcasts over the
 ACL-U logical link rather than over the ASB-U or PSB-U logical links. 
This will probably be more efficient in terms of bandwidth if the 
physical channel quality is not too degraded. Use of alternative 
transport paths is only acceptable if the characteristics of the 
application traffic type are preserved.</p>
<p>Application traffic types are used to classify the types of data that
 may be submitted to the <em>Bluetooth</em> core system. The original 
data traffic type may not be the same as the type that is submitted to 
the <em>Bluetooth</em> core system if an intervening process modifies 
it. For example, video data is generated at a constant rate but an 
intermediate coding process may alter this to variable rate, e.g. by 
MPEG4 encoding. For the purposes of the <em>Bluetooth</em> core system, 
only the characteristic of the submitted data is of interest.</p><a 
name="2"></a>
<p></p>
<h2>Framed Data Traffic </h2>The L2CAP layer services provide a 
frame-oriented transport for asynchronous and isochronous user data. The
 application submits data to this service in variable-sized frames (up 
to a negotiated maximum for the channel) and these frames are delivered 
in the same form to the corresponding application on the remote device. 
There is no requirement for the application to insert additional framing
 information into the data, although it may do so if this is required. 
(Such framing is invisible to the <em>Bluetooth</em> core system.) 
<p></p>
<p>Connection-oriented L2CAP channels may be created for transport of 
unicast (point-to-point) data between two <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled 
devices. A connectionless L2CAP channel exists for broadcasting data. In
 the case of piconet topologies the master device is always the source 
of broadcast data and the slave device(s) are the recipients. Traffic on
 the broadcast L2CAP channel is uni-directional. Unicast L2CAP channels 
may be uni-directional or bi-directional.</p>
<p>L2CAP channels have an associated QoS setting that defines 
constraints on the delivery of the frames of data. These QoS settings 
may be used to indicate, for example, that the data is isochronous and 
therefore has a limited lifetime after which it becomes invalid, that 
the data should be delivered within a given time period, or that the 
data is reliable and should be delivered without error, however long 
this takes.</p>
<p>The L2CAP channel manager is responsible for arranging to transport 
theL2CAP channel data frames on an appropriate baseband logical link, 
possibly multiplexing this onto the baseband logical link with other 
L2CAP channels with similar characteristics.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><a name="3"></a>
<p></p>
<h2>Unframed Data Traffic</h2>If the application does not require 
delivery of data in frames, possibly because it includes in-stream 
framing, or because the data is a pure stream, then it may avoid the use
 of L2CAP channels and make direct use of a baseband logical link. 
<p></p>
<p>The <em>Bluetooth</em> core system supports the direct transport of 
application data that is isochronous and of a constant rate (either 
bit-rate or frame-rate for preframed data), using a SCO-S or eSCO-S 
logical link. These logical links reserve physical channel bandwidth and
 provide a constant rate transport locked to the piconet clock. Data is 
transported in fixed size packets at fixed intervals with both of these 
parameters negotiated during channel establishment. eSCO links provide a
 greater choice of bit-rates and also provide greater reliability by 
using limited retransmission in case of error. Enhanced Data Rate 
operation is supported for eSCO, but not for SCO logical transports. SCO
 and eSCO logical transports do not support multiplexed logical links or
 any further layering within the <em>Bluetooth</em> core. An application
 may choose to layer a number of streams within the submitted SCO/eSCO 
stream, provided that the submitted stream is, or has the appearance of 
being, a constant rate stream.</p>
<p>The application chooses the most appropriate type of logical link 
from those available at the baseband, creates and configures it to 
transport the data stream and releases it when completed. (The 
application will normally also use a framed L2CAP unicast channel to 
transport its C-plane information to the peer application on the remote 
device.)</p>
<p>If the application data is isochronous and of a variable rate, then 
this may only be carried by the L2CAP unicast channel, and hence will be
 treated as framed data.</p><a name="4"></a>
<p></p>
<h2>Reliability of Traffic Bearers</h2><em>Bluetooth</em> technology is a
 wireless communications system. In poor RF environments, this system 
should be considered inherently unreliable. To counteract this the 
system provides levels of protection at each layer. The baseband packet 
header uses forward error correcting (FEC) coding to allow error 
correction by the receiver and a header error check (HEC) to detect 
errors remaining after correction. Certain Baseband packet types include
 FEC for the payload. Furthermore, some baseband packet types include a 
cyclic redundancy error check (CRC). 
<p></p>
<p>On ACL logical transports the results of the error detection 
algorithm are used to drive a simple ARQ protocol. This provides an 
enhanced reliability by re-transmitting packets that do not pass the 
receiver’s error checking algorithm. It is possible to modify this 
scheme to support latency-sensitive packets by discarding an 
unsuccessfully transmitted packet at the transmitter if the packet’s 
useful life has expired. eSCO links use a modified version of this 
scheme to improve reliability by allowing a limited number of 
retransmissions.</p>
<p>The resulting reliability gained by this ARQ scheme is only as 
dependable as the ability of the HEC and CRC codes to detect errors. In 
most cases this is sufficient, however it has been shown that for the 
longer packet types the probability of an undetected error is too high 
to support typical applications, especially those with a large amount of
 data being transferred.</p>
<p>The L2CAP layer provides an additional level of error control that is
 designed to detect the occasional undetected errors in the baseband 
layer and request retransmission of the affected data. This provides the
 level of reliability required by typical <em>Bluetooth</em> 
applications.</p>
<p>Broadcast links have no feedback route, and are unable to use the ARQ
 scheme (although the receiver is still able to detect errors in 
received packets). Instead each packet is transmitted several times in 
the hope that the receiver is able to receive at least one of the copies
 successfully. Despite this approach there are still no guarantees of 
successful receipt, and so these links are considered unreliable.</p>
<p>In summary, if a link or channel is characterized as reliable this 
means that the receiver is capable of detecting errors in received 
packets and requesting retransmission until the errors are removed. Due 
to the error detection system used some residual (undetected) errors may
 still remain in the received data. For L2CAP channels the level of 
these is comparable to other communication systems, although for logical
 links the residual error level is somewhat higher.</p>
<p>The transmitter may remove packets from the transmit queue such that 
the receiver does not receive all the packets in the sequence. If this 
happens detection of the missing packets is delegated to the L2CAP 
layer.</p>
<p>On an unreliable link the receiver is capable of detecting errors in 
received packets but cannot request retransmission. The packets passed 
on by the receiver may be without error, but there is no guarantee that 
all packets in the sequence are received. Hence the link is considered 
fundamentally unreliable. There are limited uses for such links, and 
these uses are normally dependent on the continuous repetition of data 
from the higher layers while it is valid.</p>
<p>Stream links have a reliability characteristic somewhere between a 
reliable and an unreliable link, depending on the current operating 
conditions.</p>

<h2>Transport Architecture Entities</h2><a name="6"></a>
<p></p>
<h3><em>Bluetooth</em> Generic Packet Structure</h3>The general packet 
structure reflects the architectural layers found in the <em>Bluetooth</em>
 system. The packet structure is designed for optimal use in normal 
operation. 
<p></p>
<p>Packets normally only include the fields that are necessary to 
represent the layers required by the transaction. Thus a simple inquiry 
request over an inquiry scan physical channel does not create or require
 a logical link or higher layer and therefore consists only of the 
channel access code (associated with the physical channel). General 
communication within a piconet uses packets that include all of the 
fields, as all of the architectural layers are used.</p>
<p>All packets include the channel access code. This is used to identify
 communications on a particular physical channel, and to exclude or 
ignore packets on a different physical channel that happens to be using 
the same RF carrier in physical proximity.</p>
<p>There is no direct field within the <em>Bluetooth</em> packet 
structure that represents or contains information relating to physical 
links. This information is implied in the logical transport address 
(LT_ADDR) carried in the packet header.</p>
<p>Most packets include a packet header. The packet header is always 
present in packets transmitted on physical channels that support 
physical links, logical transports and logical links. The packet header 
carries the LT_ADDR, which is used by each receiving device to determine
 if the packet is addressed to the device and is used to route the 
packet internally.</p>
<p>The packet header also carries part of the LC protocol that is 
operated per logical transport (except for ACL and SCO transports that 
operate a shared LC protocol carried on either logical transport).</p>
<p>The EDR packets have a guard time and synchronization sequence before
 the payload. This is a field used for physical layer change of 
modulation scheme.</p>
<p>The payload header is present in all packets on logical transports 
that support multiple logical links. The payload header includes a 
logical link identifier field used for routing the payload and a field 
indicating the length of the payload. Some packet types also include a 
CRC after the packet payload that is used to detect most errors in 
received packets. EDR packets have a trailer after the CRC.</p>
<p>The packet payload is used to transport the user data. The 
interpretation of this data is dependent on the logical transport and 
logical link identifiers. For ACL logical transports LMP messages and 
L2CAP signals are transported in the packet payload, along with general 
user data from applications. For SCO and eSCO logical transports the 
payload contains the user data for the logical link.</p><a name="7"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Physical Channels</h3>The lowest architectural layer in the <em>Bluetooth</em>
 wireless technology system is the physical channel. A number of types 
of physical channels are defined. All <em>Bluetooth</em> physical 
channels are characterized by an RF frequency combined with temporal 
parameters and restricted by spatial considerations. For the basic and 
adapted piconet physical channels, frequency hopping is used to change 
frequency periodically to reduce the effects of interference and for 
regulatory reasons. 
<p></p>
<p>Two <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled devices use a shared physical channel 
for communication. To achieve this their transceivers need to be tuned 
to the same RF frequency at the same time, and they need to be within a 
nominal range of each other.</p>
<p>Given that the number of RF carriers is limited and that many <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled devices may be operating independently within the same spatial 
and temporal area, there is a strong likelihood of two independent <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled devices having their transceivers tuned to the same RF carrier,
 resulting in a physical channel collision. To mitigate the unwanted 
effects of this collision each transmission on a physical channel starts
 with an access code that is used as a correlation code by devices tuned
 to the physical channel. This channel access code is a property of the 
physical channel. The access code is always present at the start of 
every transmitted packet.</p>
<p>Four <em>Bluetooth</em> physical channels are defined. Each is 
optimized and used for a different purpose. Two of these physical 
channels (the basic piconet channel and adapted piconet channel) are 
used for communication between connected devices and are associated with
 a specific piconet. The remaining physical channels are used for 
discovering <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled devices (the inquiry scan 
channel) and for connecting <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled devices (the page
 scan channel).</p>
<p>A <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled device can only use one of these 
physical channels at any given time. In order to support multiple 
concurrent operations the device uses time division multiplexing between
 the channels. In this way, a <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled device can 
appear to operate simultaneously in several piconets, as well as being 
discoverable and connectable.</p>
<p>Whenever a <em>Bluetooth</em> device is synchronized to the timing, 
frequency, and access code of a physical channel, it is said to be 
‘connected’ to this channel (whether or not it is actively involved in 
communications over the channel). The <em>Bluetooth</em> specification 
assumes that a device is only capable of connecting to one physical 
channel at any time. Advanced devices may be capable of connecting 
simultaneously to more than one physical channel, but the specification 
does not assume that this is possible.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>The basic piconet channel is used for communication 
between connected devices during normal operation. 
<p></p><a name="31"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>The basic piconet channel is characterized by a 
pseudo-random sequence hopping through the RF channels. The hopping 
sequence is unique for the piconet and is determined by the <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled device address of the master. The phase in the hopping sequence
 is determined by the <em>Bluetooth</em> clock of the master. All <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled devices participating in the piconet are time- and 
hop-synchronized to the channel. 
<p></p>
<p>The channel is divided into time slots where each slot corresponds to
 an RF hop frequency. Consecutive hops correspond to different RF hop 
frequencies. The time slots are numbered according to the <em>Bluetooth</em>
 clock of the piconet master. Packets are transmitted by <em>Bluetooth</em>
 devices participating in the piconet aligned to start at a slot 
boundary. Each packet starts with the channel’s access code, which is 
derived from the <em>Bluetooth</em> device address of the piconet.</p>
<p>On the basic piconet channel the master controls access to the 
channel. The master starts its transmission in even-numbered time slots 
only. Packets transmitted by the master are aligned with the slot start 
and define the piconet timing. Packets transmitted by the master may 
occupy up to five time slots depending on the packet type.</p>
<p>Each master transmission is a packet carrying information on one of 
the logical transports. Slave devices may transmit on the physical 
channel in response. The characteristics of the response are defined by 
the logical transport that is addressed.</p>
<p>For example, on the asynchronous connection-oriented logical 
transport the addressed slave device responds by transmitting a packet 
containing information for the same logical transport that is nominally 
aligned with the next (odd numbered) slot start. Such a packet may 
occupy up to five time slots, depending on the packet type. On a 
broadcast logical transport no slaves are allowed to respond.</p>
<p>A special characteristic of the basic piconet physical channel is the
 use of some reserved slots to transmit a beacon train. The beacon train
 is only used if the piconet physical channel has parked slaves 
connected to it. In this situation the master transmits a packet in the 
reserved beacon train slots (these packets are used by the slave to 
resynchronize to the piconet physical channel). The master may transmit 
packets from any logical transport onto these slots, providing there is a
 transmission starting in each of the slots. In the case where there is 
information from the parked slave broadcast (PSB) logical transport to 
be transmitted then this is transmitted in the beacon train slots and 
takes priority over any other logical transport.</p><a name="32"></a>

<h4>Topology</h4>A basic piconet channel may be shared by any number of <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled devices, limited only by the resources available on the piconet
 master device. Only one device is the piconet master, all others being 
piconet slaves. All communication is between the master and slave 
devices. There is no direct communication between slave devices on the 
piconet channel. 
<p></p>
<p>There is, however, a limitation on the number of logical transports 
that can be supported within a piconet. This means that although there 
is no theoretical limit to the number of <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled 
devices that share a channel, there is a limit to the number of these 
devices that can be actively involved in exchanging data with the 
master.</p><a name="33"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Supported Layers</h4>The basic piconet channel supports a number of 
physical links, logical transports, logical links and L2CAP channels 
used for general purpose communications. 
<p></p><a name="9"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Adapted Piconet Channel</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>The adapted piconet channel differs from the basic 
piconet channel in two ways. First the frequencies on which the slaves 
transmit are the same as the preceding master transmit frequency. In 
other words, the frequency is not recomputed between master and 
subsequent slave packets. The second way in which the adapted piconet 
channel differs from the basic piconet channel is that the adapted type 
can be based on fewer than the full 79 frequencies. A number of 
frequencies may be excluded from the hopping pattern by being marked as 
“unused.” The remainder of the 79 frequencies are included. The two 
sequences are the same except that whenever the basic pseudo-random 
hopping sequence would have selected an unused frequency, it is replaced
 with an alternative chosen from the used set. 
<p></p>
<p>Because the adapted piconet channel uses the same timing and access 
code as the basic piconet channel, the two channels are often 
coincident. This provides a deliberate benefit as it allows slaves in 
either the basic piconet channel or the adapted piconet channel to 
adjust their synchronization to the master.</p>
<p>The topology and supported layers of the adapted piconet physical 
channel are identical to the basic piconet physical channel.</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>In order for a device to be discovered, an inquiry scan
 channel is used. A discoverable device listens for inquiry requests on 
its inquiry scan channel and then sends responses to these requests. In 
order for a device to discover other devices, it iterates (hops) through
 all possible inquiry scan channel frequencies in a pseudo-random 
fashion, sending an inquiry request on each frequency and listening for 
any response. 
<p></p><a name="41"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>Inquiry scan channels follow a slower hopping 
pattern and use an access code to distinguish between occasional 
occupancy of the same radio frequency by two co-located devices using 
different physical channels. 
<p></p>
<p>The access code used on the inquiry scan channel is taken from a 
reserved set of inquiry access codes that are shared by all <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled devices. One access code is used for general inquiries and a 
number of additional access codes are reserved for limited inquiries. 
Each device has access to a number of different inquiry scan channels. 
As all of these channels share an identical hopping pattern, a device 
may concurrently occupy more than one inquiry scan channel if it is 
capable of concurrently correlating more than one access code.</p>
<p>A device using one of its inquiry scan channel remains passive until 
it receives an inquiry message on this channel from another <em>Bluetooth</em>
 enabled device. This is identified by the appropriate inquiry access 
code. The inquiry scanning device will then follow the inquiry response 
procedure to return a response to the inquiring device.</p>
<p>In order for a device to discover other <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled 
devices, it uses the inquiry scan channel of these devices to send 
inquiry requests. As it has no prior knowledge of the devices to 
discover, it cannot know the exact characteristics of the inquiry scan 
channel.</p>
<p>The device takes advantage of the fact that inquiry scan channels 
have a reduced number of hop frequencies and a slower rate of hopping. 
The inquiring device transmits inquiry requests on each of the inquiry 
scan hop frequencies and listens for an inquiry response. This is done 
at a faster rate, allowing the inquiring device to cover all inquiry 
scan frequencies in a reasonably short time period.</p><a name="42"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Topology</h4>Inquiring and discoverable devices use a simple 
exchange of packets to fulfill the inquiring function. The topology 
formed during this transaction is a simple and transient point-to-point 
connection. 
<p></p><a name="43"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Supported Layers</h4>During the exchange of packets between an 
inquiring and discoverable device it may be considered that a temporary 
physical link exists between these devices. However, the concept is 
quite irrelevant as it has no physical representation but is only 
implied by the brief transaction between the devices. No further 
architectural layers are considered to be supported.

<h4>Overview</h4>A connectable device (one that is prepared to accept 
connections) does sousing an page scan channel. A connectable device 
listens for page requests on its page scan channel and enters into a 
sequence of exchanges with this device. In order for a device to connect
 to another device, it iterates (hops) through all page scan channel 
frequencies in a pseudo-random fashion, sending an page request on each 
frequency and listening for any response. 
<p></p><a name="51"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Characteristics</h4>The page scan channel uses an access code 
derived from the scanning device’s <em>Bluetooth</em> device address to 
identify communications on the channel. The page scan channel uses a 
slower hopping rate than the hop rate of the basic and adapted piconet 
channels. The hop selection algorithm uses the <em>Bluetooth</em> device
 clock of the scanning device as an input. 
<p></p>
<p>A device using its page scan channel remains passive until it 
receives a page request from another <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled device. 
This is identified by the page scan channel access code. The two devices
 will then follow the page procedure to form a connection. Following a 
successful conclusion of the page procedure both devices switch to the 
basic piconet channel that is characterized by having the paging device 
as master.</p>
<p>In order for a device to connect to another <em>Bluetooth</em> 
enabled device it uses the page scan channel of the target device in 
order to send page requests. If the paging device does not know the 
phase of the target device’s page scan channel it therefore does not 
know the current hop frequency of the target device. The paging device 
transmits page requests on each of the page scan hop frequencies and 
listens for a page response. This is done at a faster hop rate, allowing
 the paging device to cover all page scan frequencies in a reasonably 
short time period.</p>
<p>The paging device may have some knowledge of the target device’s <em>Bluetooth</em>
 clock (indicated during a previous inquiry transaction between the two 
devices, or as a result of a previous involvement in a piconet with the 
device), in which case it is able to predict the phase of the target 
device’s page scan channel. It may use this information to optimize the 
synchronization of the paging and page scanning process and speed up the
 formation of the connection.</p><a name="52"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Topology</h4>Paging and connectable devices use a simple exchange of
 packets to fulfill the paging function. The topology formed during this
 transaction is a simple and transient point-to-point connection. 
<p></p><a name="53"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Supported Layers</h4>During the exchange of packets between a paging
 and connectable device it may be considered that a temporary physical 
link exists between these devices. However, the concept is quite 
irrelevant as it has no physical representation but is only implied by 
the brief transaction between the devices. No further architectural 
layers are considered to be supported. 
<p></p><a name="12"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Physical Links</h3>A physical link represents a baseband connection 
between <em>Bluetooth</em> enabled devices. A physical link is always 
associated with exactly one physical channel (although a physical 
channel may support more than one physical link). 
<p></p>
<p>Within the <em>Bluetooth</em> technology system a physical link is a 
virtual concept that has no direct representation within the structure 
of a transmitted packet. The access code packet field, together with the
 clock and address of the master <em>Bluetooth</em> device, are used to 
identify a physical channel. However there is no subsequent part of the 
packet that directly identifies the physical link. Instead the physical 
link may be identified by association with the logical transport, as 
each logical transport is only received on one physical link.</p>
<p>Some physical link types have properties that may be modified. An 
example of this is the transmit power for the link. Other physical link 
types have no such properties. In the case of physical links with 
modifiable properties the LM protocol is used to adapt these properties.
 As the LM protocol is supported at a higher layer (by a logical link) 
the appropriate physical link is identified by implication from the 
logical link that transports the LM signaling.</p>
<p>In the situation where a transmission is broadcast over a number of 
different physical links, then the transmission parameters are selected 
to be suitable for all of the physical links.</p>

<h3>Links Supported by the Basic and Adapted Piconet Physical Channel</h3>

<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li><a href="#60">Active Physical Link</a></li>
<li><a href="#61">Parked Physical Link</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>The
 basic and adapted piconet physical channels support a physical link 
which may be active or parked. The physical link is a point-to-point 
link between the master and a slave. It is always present when the slave
 is synchronized in the piconet. 
<p></p><a name="60"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Active Physical Link</h4>The physical link between a master and a 
slave device is active if a default ACL logical transport exists between
 the devices. Active physical links have no direct identification of 
their own, but are identified by association with the default ACL 
logical transport ID with which there is a one-to-one correspondence. 
<p></p>
<p>An active physical link has the associated properties of radio 
transmit power in each direction. Transmissions from slave devices are 
always directed over the active physical link to the master, and use the
 transmit power that is a property of this link in the slave to master 
direction. Transmissions from the master maybe directed over a single 
active physical link (to a specific slave) or over a number of physical 
links (to a group of slaves in the piconet). In the case of 
point-to-point transmissions the master uses the appropriate transmit 
power for the physical link in question. (In the case of 
point-to-multipoint transmissions the master uses a transmit power 
appropriate for the set of devices addressed.)</p>
<p>Active physical links may be placed into hold or sniff mode. The 
effect of these modes is to modify the periods when the physical link is
 active and may carry traffic. Logical transports that have defined 
scheduling characteristics are not affected by these modes and continue 
according to their pre-defined scheduling behavior. The default ACL 
logical transport and other links with undefined scheduling 
characteristics are subject to the mode of the active physical link.</p><a
 name="61"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Parked Physical Link</h4>The physical link between a master and a 
slave device is parked when the slave remains synchronized in the 
piconet but has no default ACL logical transport. Such a slave is also 
said to be parked. A beacon train is used to provide regular 
synchronization to all parked slaves connected to the piconet physical 
channel. A parked slave broadcast (PSB) logical transport is used to 
allow communication of a subset of LMP signaling and broadcast L2CAP to 
parked slaves. The PSB logical transport is closely associated with the 
beacon train. 
<p></p>
<p>A slave is parked (its active link is changed to a parked link) using
 the park procedure. The master is not allowed to park a slave that has 
any user created logical transport supported by the physical link. These
 logical transports are first removed, and any L2CAP channels that are 
built on these logical transports are also removed. The broadcast 
logical transport and default ACL logical transports are not considered 
as user created and are not explicitly removed. When the active link is 
replaced with a parked link the default ACL logical transport is 
implicitly removed. The supported logical links and L2CAP channels 
remain in existence but become suspended. It is not possible to use 
these links and L2CAP channels to transport signaling or data while the 
active link is absent.</p>
<p>A parked slave may become active using the unpark procedure. This 
procedure is requested by the slave at an access window and initiated by
 the master. Following the unpark procedure, the parked physical link is
 changed to an active physical link and the default ACL logical 
transport is re-created. L2CAP channels that were suspended during the 
most recent park procedure are associated with the new default ACL 
logical transport and become active again.</p>
<p>Parked links do not support radio power control, as there is no 
feedback path from parked slaves to the piconet master that can be used 
to signal received signal strength at the slave or for the master to 
measure received signal strength from the slave. Transmissions are 
carried out at nominal power on parked links.</p>
<p>Parked links use the same physical channel as their associated active
 link. If a master manages a piconet that contains parked slaves using 
the basic piconet physical channel and also parked slaves using the 
adapted piconet physical channel then it must create a parked slave 
broadcast logical transport (and associated transport) for each of these
 physical channels.</p>
<p>A parked slave may use the inactive periods of the parked slave 
broadcast logical transport to save power, or it may carry out 
activities on other physical channels unrelated to the piconet within 
which it is parked.</p><a name="14"></a>

<p></p><a name="70"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Logical Links and Logical Transports</h4>A variety of logical links 
are available to support different application data transport 
requirements. Each logical link is associated with a logical transport, 
which has a number of characteristics. These characteristics include 
flow control, acknowledgement/repeat mechanisms, sequence numbering and 
scheduling behavior. Logical transports are able to carry different 
types of logical links (depending on the type of the logical transport).
 In the case of some of the <em>Bluetooth</em> Version 1.1 logical links
 these are multiplexed onto the same logical transport. Logical 
transports may be carried by active physical links on either the basic 
or the adapted piconet physical channel. 
<p></p>
<p>Logical transport identification and real-time (link control) 
signaling are carried in the packet header and for some logical links, 
identification is carried in the payload header. Control signaling that 
does not require single slot response times is carried out using the LMP
 protocol.</p><a name="71"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The names given to the logical links and logical transports reflect 
some of the names used in <em>Bluetooth</em> Version 1.1, in order to 
provide some degree of familiarity and continuation. However these names
 do not reflect a consistent scheme, which is outlined below.</p>
<p>The classification of each link type follows from a selection 
procedure within three categories.</p><a name="72"></a>
<p></p>
<h4>Casting</h4>The first category is that of casting. This may be 
either unicast or broadcast. There are no multicast links defined in <em>Bluetooth</em>
 Version 1.2. 
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Unicast links. Unicast links exist between exactly two endpoints. 
Traffic may be sent in either direction on unicast links. All unicast 
links are connection-oriented, meaning that a connection procedure takes
 place before the link may be used. In the case of the default ACL 
links, the connection procedure is an implicit step within the general 
paging procedure used to form ad-hoc piconets. </li>
<li>Broadcast links. Broadcast links exist between one source device and
 zero or more receiver devices. Traffic is unidirectional, i.e. only 
sent from the source devices to the receiver devices. Broadcast links 
are connectionless, meaning that there is no procedure to create these 
links, and data may be sent over them at any time. Broadcast links are 
unreliable, and there is no guarantee that the data will be received.</li></ul><a
 name="73"></a>
<h4>Scheduling and Acknowledgement Scheme</h4>
<p>The second category relates to the scheduling and acknowledgement 
scheme of the link and implies the type of traffic that is supported by 
the link. These are synchronous, isochronous or asynchronous. There are 
no specific isochronous links defined in <em>Bluetooth</em> Version 1.2,
 though the default ACL link can be configured to operate in this 
fashion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous links. Synchronous links provide a method of associating
 the <em>Bluetooth</em> piconet clock with the transported data. This is
 achieved by reserving regular slots on the physical channel, and 
transmitting fixed size packets at these regular intervals. Such links 
are suitable for constant rate isochronous data. </li>
<li>Asynchronous links. Asynchronous links provide a method for 
transporting data that has no time-based characteristics. The data is 
normally expected to be retransmitted until successfully received and 
each data entity can be processed at any time after receipt without 
reference to the time of receipt of any previous or successive entity in
 the stream (providing the ordering of data entities is preserved). </li>
<li>Isochronous links. Isochronous links provide a method for 
transporting data that has time-based characteristics. The data may be 
retransmitted until received or expired. The data rate on the link need 
not be constant (this being the main difference from synchronous links).</li></ul><a
 name="74"></a>
<h4>Class of Data</h4>
<p>The final category is related to the class of data that is carried by
 the link. This is either control (LMP) data or user data. The user data
 category is sub-divided into L2CAP (or framed) data and stream (or 
unframed) data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Control links. Control links are only used for transporting LMP 
messages between two link managers. These links are invisible above the 
baseband layer, and cannot be directly instantiated, configured or 
released by applications, other than by the use of the connection and 
disconnection services that have this effect implicitly. Control links 
are always multiplexed with an equivalent L2CAP link onto an ACL logical
 transport. Subject to the rules defining the ARQ scheme, the control 
link traffic always takes priority over the L2CAP link traffic. </li>
<li>L2CAP links. L2CAP links are used to transport L2CAP PDUs, which may
 carry the L2CAP signaling channel (on the default ACL-U logical link 
only) or framed user data submitted to user-instantiated L2CAP channels.
 L2CAPframes submitted to the baseband may be larger than the available 
baseband packets. A link control protocol embedded within the LLID field
 preserves the frame-start and frame-continuation semantics when the 
frame is transmitted in a number of fragments to the receiver. </li>
<li>Stream links. Stream links are used to transport user data that has 
no inherent framing that should be preserved when delivering the data. 
Lost data may be replaced by padding at the receiver.</li></ul><a 
name="15"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Asynchronous Connection-Oriented (ACL)</h3>The asynchronous 
connection-oriented (ACL) logical transport is used to carry LMP and 
L2CAP control signaling and best effort asynchronous user data. The ACL 
logical transport uses a simple 1-bit ARQN/SEQN scheme to provide simple
 channel reliability. Every active slave device within a piconet has one
 ACL logical transport to the piconet master, known as the default ACL. 
<p></p>
<p>The default ACL is created between the master and the slave when a 
device joins a piconet (connects to the basic piconet physical channel).
 This default ACL is assigned a logical transport address (LT_ADDR) by 
the piconet master. This LT_ADDR is also used to identify the active 
physical link when required (or as a piconet active member identifier, 
effectively for the same purpose).</p>
<p>The LT_ADDR for the default ACL is reused for synchronous 
connection-oriented logical transports between the same master and 
slave. (This is for reasons of compatibility with earlier <em>Bluetooth</em>
 specifications.) Thus the LT_ADDR is not sufficient on its own to 
identify the default ACL. However the packet types used on the ACL are 
different from those used on the synchronous connection-oriented logical
 transport. Therefore, the ACL logical transport can be identified by 
the LT_ADDR field in the packet header in combination with the packet 
type field.</p>
<p>The default ACL may be used for isochronous data transport by 
configuring it to automatically flush packets after the packets have 
expired.</p>
<p>If the default ACL is removed from the active physical link then all 
other logical transports that exist between the master and the slave are
 also removed. In the case of unexpected loss of synchronization to the 
piconet physical channel the physical link and all logical transports 
and logical links cease to exist at the time that this synchronization 
loss is detected.</p>
<p>A device may remove its default ACL (and by implication its active 
physical link) but remain synchronized to the piconet. This procedure is
 known as parking, and a device that is synchronized to the piconet, but
 has no active physical link, is parked within that piconet.</p>
<p>When the device transitions to the parked state, the default ACL 
logical links that are transported on the default ACL logical transport 
remain in existence but become suspended. No data may be transferred 
across a suspended logical link. When the device transitions from the 
parked state back into active state, a new default ACL logical transport
 is created (it may have a different LT_ADDR from the previous one) and 
the suspended logical links are attached to this default ACL and become 
active once again.</p><a name="16"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO)</h3>The synchronous 
connection-oriented (SCO) logical transport is a symmetric, 
point-to-point channel between the master and a specific slave. The SCO 
logical transport reserves slots on the physical channel and can 
therefore be considered as a circuit-switched connection between the 
master and the slave. SCO logical transports carry 64 kb/s of 
information synchronized with the piconet clock. Typically this 
information is an encoded voice stream. Three different SCO 
configurations exist, offering a balance between robustness, delay, and 
bandwidth consumption. 
<p></p>
<p>Each SCO-S logical link is supported by a single SCO logical 
transport, which is assigned the same LT_ADDR as the default ACL logical
 transport between the devices. Therefore the LT_ADDR field is not 
sufficient to identify the destination of a received packet. Because the
 SCO links use reserved slots, a device uses a combination of the 
LT_ADDR, the slot numbers (a property of the physical channel), and the 
packet type to identify transmissions on the SCO link.</p>
<p>The reuse of the default ACL’s LT_ADDR for SCO logical transports is 
due to legacy behavior from the <em>Bluetooth</em> Version 1.1 
specification. In this earlier version of the <em>Bluetooth</em> 
specification, the LT_ADDR (then known as the active member address) was
 used to identify the piconet member associated with each transmission. 
This was not easily extensible for enabling more logical links, and so 
the purpose of this field was redefined for the new features. Some <em>Bluetooth</em>
 Version 1.1 features, however, do not cleanly fit into the more 
formally described architecture.</p>
<p>Although slots are reserved for the SCO, it is permissible to use a 
reserved slot for traffic from another channel that has a higher 
priority. This may be required as a result of QoS commitments, or to 
send LMP signaling on the default ACL when the physical channel 
bandwidth is fully occupied by SCOs. As SCOs carry different packet 
types to ACLs, the packet type is used to identify SCO traffic (in 
addition to the slot number and LT_ADDR.) There are no further 
architectural layers defined by the Bluetooth core specification that 
are transported over an SCO link. A number of standard formats are 
defined for the 64 kb/s stream that is transported, or an unformatted 
stream is allowed where the application is responsible for interpreting 
the encoding of the stream.</p>
<p>3.5.6 Extended Synchronous Connection-Oriented (eSCO)<br>The extended
 synchronous connection-oriented (eSCO) logical transport is asymmetric 
or asymmetric, point-to-point link between the master and a specific 
slave. The eSCO reserves slots on the physical channel and can therefore
 be considered as a circuit-switched connection between the master and 
the slave. eSCO links offer a number of extensions over the standard SCO
 links, in that they support a more flexible combination of packet types
 and selectable data contents in the packets and selectable slot 
periods, allowing a range of synchronous bit rates to be supported.</p>
<p>eSCO links also can offer limited retransmission of packets (unlike 
SCO links where there is no retransmission). If these retransmissions 
are required they take place in the slots that follow the reserved 
slots, otherwise the slots may be used for other traffic.</p>
<p>Each eSCO-S logical link is supported by a single eSCO logical 
transport, identified by a LT_ADDR that is unique within the piconet for
 the duration of the eSCO. eSCO-S links are created using LM signaling 
and follow scheduling rules similar to SCO-S links.</p>
<p>There are no further architectural layers defined by the <em>Bluetooth</em>
 core specification that are transported over an eSCO-S link. Instead, 
applications may use the data stream for whatever purpose they require, 
subject to the transport characteristics of the stream being suitable 
for the data being transported.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><a name="17"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>Active Slave Broadcast (ASB)</h3>The active slave broadcast logical 
transport is used to transport L2CAP user traffic to all devices in the 
piconet that are currently connected to the physical channel that is 
used by the ASB. There is no acknowledgement protocol and the traffic is
 uni-directional from the piconet master to the slaves. The ASB channel 
may be used for L2CAP group traffic (a legacy of the Version 1.1 
specification), and is never used for L2CAP connection-oriented 
channels, L2CAP control signaling or LMP control signaling. 
<p></p>
<p>The ASB logical transport is inherently unreliable because of the 
lack of acknowledgement. To improve the reliability, each packet is 
transmitted a number of times. An identical sequence number is used to 
assist with filtering retransmissions at the slave device.</p>
<p>The ASB logical transport is identified by a reserved LT_ADDR. (The 
reserved LT_ADDR address is also used by the PSB logical transport.) An 
active slave will receive traffic on both logical transports and cannot 
readily distinguish between them. As the ASB logical transport does not 
carry LMP traffic, an active slave can ignore packets received over the 
LMP logical link on the ASB logical transport. However, L2CAP traffic 
transmitted over the PSB logical transport is also received by active 
slaves on the ASB logical transport and cannot be distinguished from 
L2CAP traffic sent on the ASB transport.</p>
<p>An ASB is implicitly created whenever a piconet exists, and there is 
always one ASB associated with each of the basic and adapted piconet 
physical channels that exist within the piconet. Because the basic and 
adapted piconet physical channels are mostly coincident, a slave device 
cannot distinguish which of the ASB channels is being used to transmit 
the packets. This adds to the general unreliability of the ASB channel. 
(Although it is, perhaps, no more unreliable than general missed 
packets.)</p>
<p>A master device may decide to use only one of its two possible ASBs 
(when it has both a basic and adapted piconet physical channel), as with
 sufficient retransmissions it is possible to address both groups of 
slaves on the same ASB channel.</p>
<p>The ASB channel is never used to carry LMP or L2CAP control signals.</p><a

<h3>Parked Slave Broadcast (PSB)</h3>The parked slave broadcast logical 
transport is used for communications between the master and slaves that 
are parked (have given up their default ACL logical transport). The 
parked slave broadcast link is the only logical transport that exists 
between the piconet master and parked slaves. 
<p></p>
<p>The PSB logical transport is more complex than the other logical 
transports as it consists of a number of phases, each having a different
 purpose. These phases are the control information phase (used to carry 
the LMP logical link), the user information phase (used to carry the 
L2CAP logical link), and the access phase (carrying baseband signaling).
 The control information and broadcast information phases are usually 
mutually exclusive as only one of them can be supported in a single 
beacon interval. (Even if there is no controller user information phase,
 the master is still required to transmit a packet in the beacon slots 
so that the parked slaves can resynchronize.) The access phase is 
normally present unless cancelled in a control information message.</p>
<p>The control information phase is used for the master to send 
information to the parked slaves containing modifications to the PSB 
transport attributes, modifications to the beacon train attributes or a 
request for a parked slave to become active in the piconet (known as 
unparking). This control information is carried in LMP messages on the 
LMP logical link. (The control information phase is also present in the 
case of a user information phase where the user information requires 
more than one baseband packet.)</p>
<p>Packets in the control information phase are always transmitted in 
the physical channel beacon train slots and cannot be transmitted on any
 other slots. The control information occupies a single DM1 packet and 
is repeated in every beacon train slot within a single beacon interval. 
(If there is no control information then there may be a user information
 phase that uses the beacon slots. If neither phase is used then the 
beacon slots are used for other logical transport traffic or for NULL 
packets.)</p>
<p>The user information phase is used for the master to send L2CAP 
packets that are destined for all piconet slaves. User information may 
occupy one or more baseband packets. If the user information occupies a 
single packet then the user information packet is repeated in each of 
the piconet channel beacon train slots.</p>
<p>If the user information occupies more than one baseband packets then 
it is transmitted in slots after the beacon train (the broadcast scan 
window), and the beacon slots are used to transmit a control information
 phase message that contains the timing attributes of this broadcast 
scan window. This is required so that the parked slaves remain connected
 to the piconet physical channel to receive the user information.</p>
<p>The access phase is normally present unless temporarily cancelled by a
 control message carried in the control information broadcast phase. The
 access window consists of a sequence of slots that follow the beacon 
train. In order for a parked slave to become active in the piconet, it 
must send such an access request to the piconet master during the access
 window. Each parked slave is allocated an access request address (not 
necessarily unique) that controls when during the access window the 
slave requests access.</p>
<p>The PSB logical transport is identified by the reserved LT_ADDR of 0.
 This reserved LT_ADDR address is also used by the ASB logical 
transport. Parked slaves are not normally confused by the duplicated use
 of the LT_ADDR as they are only connected to the piconet physical 
channel during the time that the PSB transport is being used.</p><a

<h3>Logical Links</h3>Some logical transports are capable of supporting 
different logical links, either concurrently multiplexed, or one of the 
choice. Within such logical transports, the logical link is identified 
by the logical link identifier (LLID) bits in the payload header of 
baseband packets that carry a data payload. The logical links 
distinguish between a limited set of core protocols that are able to 
transmit and receive data on the logical transports. Not all of the 
logical transports are able to carry all of the logical links. In 
particular the SCO and eSCO logical transports are only able to carry 
constant data rate streams, and these are uniquely identified by the 
LT_ADDR. Such logical transports only use packets that do not contain a 
payload header, as their length is known in advance, and no LLID is 
necessary. 
<p></p><a name="20"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>ACL Control Logical Link (ACL-C)</h3>The ACL control logical link 
(ACL-C) is used to carry LMP signaling between devices in the piconet. 
The control link is only carried on the default ACL logical transport 
and on the PSB logical transport (in the control information phase).The 
ACL-C link is always given priority over the ACL-U (see below) link when
 carried on the same logical transport. 
<p></p><a name="21"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>User Asynchronous/Isochronous Logical Link (ACL-U)</h3>The user 
asynchronous/isochronous logical link (ACL-U) is used to carry all 
asynchronous and isochronous framed user data. The ACL-U link is carried
 on all but the synchronous logical transports. Packets on the ACL-U 
link are identified by one of two reserved LLID values. One value is 
used to indicate whether the baseband packet contains the start of an 
L2CAP frame and the other indicates a continuation of a previous frame. 
This ensures correct synchronization of the L2CAP reassembler following 
flushed packets. The use of this technique removes the need for a more 
complex L2CAP header in every baseband packet (the header is only 
required in the L2CAP start packets), but adds the requirement that a 
complete L2CAP frame shall be transmitted before a new one is 
transmitted. (An exception to this rule being the ability to flush a 
partially transmitted L2CAP frame in favor of another L2CAP frame.) 
<p></p><a name="22"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>User Synchronous/Extended Synchronous Logical Links (SCO-S/eSCO-S)</h3>Synchronous
 (SCO-S) and extended synchronous (eSCO-S) logical links are used to 
support isochronous data delivered in a stream without framing. These 
links are associated with a single logical transport where data is 
delivered in constant sized units at a constant rate. There is no LLID 
within the packets on these transports, as only a single logical link 
can be supported, and the packet length and scheduling period are 
pre-defined and remain fixed during the lifetime of the link. 
<p></p>
<p>Variable rate isochronous data cannot be carried by the SCO-S or 
eSCO-S logical links. In this case the data must be carried on ACL-U 
logical links, which use packets with a payload header. <em>Bluetooth</em>
 technology has some limitations when supporting variable-rate 
isochronous data concurrently with reliable user data.</p><a name="23"></a>
<p></p>
<h3>L2CAP Channels</h3>L2CAP provides a multiplexing role allowing many 
different applications to share the resources of an ACL-U logical link 
between two devices. Applications and service protocols interface with 
L2CAP using a channel-oriented interface to create connections to 
equivalent entities on other devices. 
<p></p>
<p>L2CAP channel endpoints are identified to their clients by a channel 
identifier (CID). This is assigned by L2CAP, and each L2CAP channel 
endpoint on any device has a different CID.</p>
<p>L2CAP channels may be configured to provide an appropriate QoS to the
 application. L2CAP maps the channel onto the ACL-U logical link.</p>
<p>L2CAP supports channels that are connection-oriented and others that 
are group-oriented. Group-oriented channels may be mapped onto the ASB-U
 logical link, or implemented as iterated transmission to each member in
 turn over an ACL-U logical link.</p>
<p>Apart from the creation, configuration and dismantling of channels, 
the main role of L2CAP is to multiplex service data units (SDUs) from 
the channel clients onto the ACL-U logical links, and to carry out a 
simple level of scheduling, selecting SDUs according to relative 
priority.</p>
<p>L2CAP can provide a per channel flow control with the peer L2CAP 
layer. This option is selected by the application when the channel is 
established. L2CAPcan also provide enhanced error detection and 
retransmission to (a) reduce the probability of undetected errors being 
passed to the application and (b) recover from loss of portions of the 
user data when the baseband layer performs a flush on the ACL-U logical 
link.</p>
<p>In the case where an HCI is present, the L2CAP is also required to 
segment L2CAP SDUs into fragments that will fit into the baseband 
buffers, and also to operate a token based flow control procedure over 
the HCI, submitting fragments to the baseband only when allowed to do 
so. This may affect the scheduling algorithm.</p>
